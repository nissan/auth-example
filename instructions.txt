We are building the following:
Create a small backend app that performs user authentication and fetches information. Consider this app is part of a microservice architecture.

The threat model for this application requires strong authentication and authorization. Consider the application needs to be monitored by the Security team as well.

Implement basic security controls on the endpoints.

Create a README file that contains any controls that you havenâ€™t implemented because they would require infrastructure or are too complex to write for this specific exercise. Justify your decisions.

The app should have the following endpoints:

POST /users: Users can self-register on your app
The user should input the follow information:
Name
E-mail
Date of Birth
Job title
How to secure this process is up to you.
POST /login: Users can login in your app
Do not use any external service like Auth0 here
Save users into a DB, sqlite is fine for this exercise.
Once the user is logged in, generate a JWT token.
How to secure this process is up to you
GET /users/{id}: Retrieves user information.
It should have access control
It should fetch the user data from the DB
